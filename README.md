# vscode-kinematics-model

We introduce a text and graphical IDE based on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) (desktop) and [Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) (web), with the kinematic model descibed in https://github.com/ipa320/kinematics-model as the base. This IDE allows creating kinematic models from scratch and composing those models. 

The text-based editor provides typical IDE features like code completion and navigation to declaration of a symbol. The graphical editor allows editing and visualizing the model as a TF tree. A live visualization of the models can be previewed in a side panel while editing in both tools. 

### Usage
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ipa-hsd/vscode-kinematics-model.git
$ cd vscode-kinematics-model/kinematics
vscode-kinematics-model/kinematics$ code .
```
To start the extension in debug mode, press `F5`.
